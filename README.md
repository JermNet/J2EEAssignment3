# HOW TO RUN
1. Open the "SPRINGCLOUDPROJECT" folder in Intellij
2. Run the "EurekaServerApplication" FIRST. You can run all of the modules at the same time, but Intellij DOES NOT run them in the order they are needed
3. Run the rest of the modules for all of the features of this projct

# WHAT IS THIS?
This is an assignment for my J2EE course, we were allowed to do any branch of Spring we haven't used before, so I decided on Spring cloud (specifically Netflix Eureka), making a knowledge database of sorts by making UI and non-UI modules for a few different APIs to get a collection of information in one place.
